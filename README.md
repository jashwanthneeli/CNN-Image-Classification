## Overview
This repository showcases my work on various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for image classification, completed for CSC 578, Assignment 7. The project involves adjusting hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

## Best Model Performance
- **Kaggle Score:** 
  - Public Score: 0.90277
  - Private Score: 0.92491

## Best Model Overview
- **Architecture:** Three convolutional layers with 'same' padding.
- **Filters:** First two layers with 32 filters, third layer with 64 filters, filter sizes of 3x3 and 5x5.
- **Additional Features:** Added padding and one additional hidden layer.

## Hyperparameters
- Filters (3x3, 5x5)
- Convolution layers
- Fully connected layers
- Dropout layers and percentages
- Regularization
- BatchNormalization layers
- Learning rate, regularization, dropout percent

## Total Parameters
